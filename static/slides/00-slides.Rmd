# Installing R and R Studio 

+ First, you will need to download R if you haven't already. You can do that at this link: <https://www.r-project.org/>

+ Second, you'll want to download R studio. You can use R without R studio, but you probably don't want to. R studio is an integrated development environment (IDE; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>). R studio can be downloaded at the following link: <https://www.rstudio.com/>

+ Okay, that is all you need to start your gloRious adventuRe.

# Why Use R?
## It's Open Source


--


+ It's free!


--


+ It's Easier to share your data & code


--


+ Innovations spread quickly


--


+ *you* can contribute!


---
# Why Use R?


--
## It's powerful & flexible


--


+ You can use R for more than data analysis, including:

  + creating websites
  
  + creating documents that reproduce your analyses
  
  + slideshows (including *this one*)
  
  + books


--


+ In R, it is never *if* but *how*...


---
# Why Use R?


--
## It's a useful, transferable skill


+ R is used across many industries, esp. in UX & data science.


---
# Why Use R?


--
## Reduce Errors, Enhance Reproducibility & Transparency


+ Generate Publication Quality Figures & Tables within R, reducing copypasta errors

+ Create detailed and fully documented scripts showing every step between raw data & a statistic

+ You can use R to report your analyses (for HW or publication), reducing all too common errors in reported statistics see [see Nuijten et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2).


---
# Why Use R?


--
## It's Efficient
+ Once you get used to it and start using R, it saves you time in the long run.

+ Scripts make re-using past work or using others' work as a starting point much easier.

+ Typing scripts is much faster than clicking through menus, *especially* after you get the hang of keyboard shortcuts

+ It runs faster and is less bloated than GUI stat software (e.g., SPSS)

## It's Fun!

No, seriously!
