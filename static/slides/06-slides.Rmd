# Data visualization with {ggplot2}

---
# ggplot

ggplot2 is the *grammar of graphics*, and is the tidyverse package for creating plots. 

--

Even with just a few of its commands, it can make beautiful, publication-ready plots. 

--

Its more advanced features add even more versatility. 

--

And, people make companion packages for it to do even more (e.g., `ggpubr` to  add statistics to your plot).

# Palmer penguins

We're going to use the **Palmer Penguins** dataset as an example throughout our discussion of `ggplot`.

--

This data comes from the `palmerpenuins` package, which you can download from CRAN using `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`. 

--

And remember, to load the package in order to get access to the dataset included (which is named `penguins`), use `library(penguins)`. 

--

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

# ggplot2

We're going to create this plot together, step-by-step, using `ggplot2`!

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/penguins_hist.png")
```

---

# ggplot2

When creating a plot in ggplot2, the first thing you have to do is call the `ggplot()` function. It takes data as its first argument. Let's start there:

--

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r plot-1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r plot-1-out, ref.label="plot-1", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5)}
```
]
]

---
# ggplot2

Ok, all we got was a blank square...

--

To understand why, let's back up to the philosophy of `ggplot`...

---
# ggplot2

### What is a statistical graphic? 

--

According to  [Hadley Wickham](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098), we can think of statistical graphics as:

--
* **Mappings** from data to aesthetic attributes (color, shape, size) 
* Of **geometric objects** (points, lines, bars)
* On a particular **coordinate system** (or scale)
* Sometimes after a statistical **transformation**

--
***

In `ggplot`, that combination of things forms a *layer*. The `ggplot` terminology is:

--

* **aes** - aesthetic mappings
* **geom** - geometric objects
* **scale** - scales
* **stat** - statistical transformations

---
# ggplot

Putting all that together, the flow of information in ggplot2 is...

--

1. `data` is attached to the ggplot call...

--

2. mapped by `aes()`...

--

3. transformed by `stat` before being passed to a `geom()`...

--

4. which is placed, sized, and colored according to its relevant `scale`...

--

5. then ta-da! rendered plot.

--
***

We already did step 1 above, by providing our `penguins` dataset to `ggplot()`. Let's move onto aesthetic mapping.

# But first... pipes!
# %>%

---
background-image: url(images/hex/magrittr.png)
background-position: 90% 5%
background-size: 12%

# Pipe operator

--

Pipes are a way to write code in a way that is easier to read and understand. They allow you to string a series of functions together into a pipeline.

--
***

### .center[`%>%`]

Strictly speaking, a pipe passes an object on the **left-hand side** as the first argument of whatever function is on the **right-hand side**. 

--

In general form, this means that...

`x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`

--
***

The first argument of many tidyverse functions is `data`. This is the case for `ggplot()`, as we just saw. 

--

tidyverse functions are designed this way to make it easier to use pipes! 

---
# Pipe operator

Let's take another look at the code we just wrote:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

--
***

We can re-write this code by "piping" the first argument, `data = penguins` to the function, `ggplot()` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot()
```

--
***

You can think of the pipe as representing the phrase "and then..."

--

Verbally, we might describe the code we just wrote as "Start with the `penguins` data, and then start a plot"

--
***

`r emo::ji("keyboard")` You can enter a pipe with the shortcut `CTRL+Shift+M` for PC or `CMD+Shift+M` for Mac.

# Your Turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

The code below calculates the mean of the variable `flipper_length_mm` in the `penguins` dataset. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

1. Run the code chunk provided to calculate the mean of `flipper_length_mm`.

1. Re-write the code above using the pipe operator, `%>%`. Check that the answer you get matches the original code you ran above.

# Now back to ggplot...

# Aesthetic mapping

The basic idea with aesthetic mapping is that we want to take our data and map it onto physical space using geometric objects, or `geoms`. 

--

For `ggplot` to place a `geom`, it needs to know how the data map onto the aesthetics of the graph.

--

Each `geom()` function in `ggplot` takes a mapping argument. 

--

Let’s start with a basic geom, `geom_histogram()`...

---
# Mapping with geoms

We're going to call `ggplot()` again, and this time add the `geom_histogram()` *layer*, telling it to map the variable `flipper_length_mm` to the x-axis aesthetic

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-hist-basic, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)
    ) 
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r penguins-hist-basic-out, ref.label="penguins-hist-basic", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```

]
]

---
# Mapping with geoms 

You can add additional arguments to the `geom()`. For example, we could change the number of bins

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-hist-bins, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram( 
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm),
    bins = 10 
    )
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]


```{r penguins-hist-bins-out, ref.label="penguins-hist-bins", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]
]

---
# Mapping with geoms

Or make them a different color. We can change the color of 2-d objects with the `fill` aesthetic

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-hist-fill, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram( 
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm),
    fill = "red" 
    )
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r penguins-hist-fill-out, ref.label="penguins-hist-fill", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```
]
]

---
# Mapping with geoms

Now we'll ue a different `geom` -- we'll add a layer of points to our plot using `geom_point()`

```{r penguins-point-error, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)
  )
```


```{r penguins-point-error-out, ref.label="penguins-point-error", error=TRUE}
```

---
# Mapping with geoms

We get an error, telling us that `geom_point()` requires the y-aesthetic to be defined. Let's add `bill_length_mm` as the y-axis

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-point-fixed, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                  y = bill_length_mm)
  )
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r penguins-point-fixed-out, ref.label="penguins-point-fixed", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

]
]




---
# Mapping with geoms

Let's find out if the relationship between `flipper_length_mm` & `bill_length_mm` relates to the `species` of penguin. We'll map `species` to the `color` aesthetic (similar to `fill`, but for 1-d objects).

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-point-color, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                  y = bill_length_mm,
                  color = species)
  )
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r penguins-point-color-out, ref.label="penguins-point-color", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```
]
]

---
# Mapping with geoms 

Notice that we included `color` *INSIDE* our aesthetic mapping call (`mapping = aes()`) here, but not when we filled our histogram with the color red earlier

--

This is the difference between mapping an aesthetic to ***data*** and just setting an aesthetic to some ***value*** (e.g., "red").

--

This is a fairly common mistake, so let's take a look at what happens if we tell it to make our points red but accidentally include that inside the `aes()` call...

---
# Mapping with geoms

`r emo::ji("warning")`  WARNING `r emo::ji("warning")` This is not what we want! `ggplot` is treating the value "red" as if it were part of our data, which it isn't

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-point-red, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                  y = bill_length_mm,
                  color = "red")
  )
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r penguins-point-red-out, ref.label="penguins-point-red", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

Options for aesthetics include `color`, `shape`, `size`, and `alpha` (transparency, 0-1 scale). 

1. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between `flipper_length_mm` and `bill_length_mm`. 

1. Add an aesthetic to visualize the effect of `species`. Choose any aesthetic you’d like or play around with a few. What do they do? How might you use more than one aesthetic?

# Mapping with geoms

We could also make separate graphs for each `species` using `facet_wrap`. We do this by passing a one-sided formula to `facet_wrap()`

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r penguins-point-facet, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                 y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]

```{r penguins-point-facet-out, ref.label="penguins-point-facet", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```
]
]

---
# Mapping with geoms

Another thing we often want to do is to add a line over our scatterplot to describe the linear relationship between variables. We can do this by adding a `geom_smooth()` layer to our plot.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code 1]


```{r penguins-smooth, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                 y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                 y = bill_length_mm))
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot 1]

.pull-left[
```{r penguins-smooth-out, ref.label="penguins-smooth", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```
]

.pull-right[
Note that "loess" is the default function for geom_smooth(). 

Learn more on that [here](http://www.statisticshowto.com/lowess-smoothing/).
]

]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code 2]

You can change that by setting the `method` argument in `geom_smooth()`. Let's change it to our old friend linear regression or "lm"

```{r point-smooth-lm, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                 y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                 y = bill_length_mm),
              method = "lm")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot 2]


```{r point-smooth-lm-out, ref.label="point-smooth-lm", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4.8, 4.5), warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

]
]

]

---
# Global aesthetic mapping


That looks pretty good, but this code is getting inefficient, because we're specifying the x and y axis for each `geom_*` call. Instead, we can use *global* aesthetic mappings, which are specified in the `ggplot()` call. Global mappings are inherited by each layer unless they're overwritten.
