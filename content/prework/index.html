<p>Hello! Welcome to the 3rd Annual UO Psych R Bootcamp. As we are forced to run the bootcamp online this year due to COVID-19, there are a few things we’d like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<div class="clock">
<p>If possible, please try to complete this checklist <em>before</em> the first session on Monday 9/21. Thank you!</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make sure you have a <a href="https://service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=101392">Zoom account</a> set up through University of Oregon. We will use the same Zoom link for each day of the bootcamp, and you will receive the link via email and slack.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://uodatascience.slack.com/">slack workspace</a>. This how we will primarily be communicating with each other, and it is the best place to ask questions outside of bootcamp hours. We’ll be using the channel <code>#bootcamp2020</code>. You should have received an email invitation to join the <code>SlackRs</code> workspace on 9/17 (check your Junk/Spam inbox) – if you haven’t received an invitation, send Brendan an email at <a href="mailto:bcullen@uoregon.edu">bcullen@uoregon.edu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Join the <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/94452/join?access_code=E3V8Vd%2FB%2F5edCEBphs4kuttNb6epLuRbqzab2L8J">RStudio Cloud workspace</a>. When you click this link you will be prompted to create a free RStudio Cloud account. Follow the instructions and click “Join space” when prompted. You should find yourself inside a workspace called <code>UO Psych Bootcamp 2020</code>. Please don’t open any of the materials just yet – we’ll go through these together during the bootcamp.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the <a href="/#code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all soon. Hopefully we’ll have you loving R in no time!</p>
<p>-Brendan</p>
