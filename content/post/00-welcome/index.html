<p>Welcome, everyone! I hope you find this R bootcamp useful for your learning. There’s a LOT going on in the world right now, and if learning R (let alone learning <em>anything</em> new) feels next to impossible at the moment – I totally get it. But rest assured that there is an abundance of resources at your disposal and a community here to support you!</p>
