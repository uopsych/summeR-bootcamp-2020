Almost always when you are given data to analyze, it will not be in a format in which you are immediately able to create visualizations, perform modelling, generate tables etc. In other words, it needs to be wrangled into the right format. The `dplyr` package has a very powerful set of functions for just this, and today we will be covering the core `dplyr` "verbs" that allow you to transform your data with optimal specificity and efficiency.
